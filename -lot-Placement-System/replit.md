# Enterprise √élot Placement System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive enterprise-grade √Ælot placement system for architectural space planning. The application analyzes floor plans and automatically generates optimized √Ælot layouts with intelligent placement algorithms, constraint compliance, and professional visualization capabilities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a sophisticated enterprise architecture pattern:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit framework with professional styling and interactive components
- **Backend**: Advanced Python-based algorithms for spatial analysis and optimization
- **Data Processing**: Multi-format file parsing (CAD, images) with computer vision
- **Visualization**: Interactive 2D visualization with Plotly for professional presentations
- **Export**: Professional PDF and JSON reporting capabilities

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Enterprise-grade processing**: Chosen for professional architectural applications
   - **Problem**: Need for robust spatial analysis and √Ælot placement optimization
   - **Solution**: Advanced algorithms with constraint-based placement and corridor generation
   - **Pros**: Professional results, scalable architecture, comprehensive feature set
   - **Cons**: Complex implementation requiring specialized knowledge

2. **Multi-format input support**: Handles diverse file types
   - **Problem**: Architects work with various file formats (DXF, DWG, images)
   - **Solution**: Unified parsing system with computer vision for image analysis
   - **Pros**: Flexible input handling, broad compatibility
   - **Cons**: Increased complexity in parsing logic

3. **Intelligent placement algorithms**: Optimized spatial distribution
   - **Problem**: Manual √Ælot placement is time-consuming and suboptimal
   - **Solution**: Automated placement with constraint satisfaction and optimization
   - **Pros**: Efficient space utilization, consistent results, time savings

## Expected Functionality

### 1. Loading the Plan
- Supports multiple file formats (DXF, DWG, images)
- Automatically detects:
  - Walls (black lines)
  - Restricted areas (blue zones) - stairs, elevators
  - Entrances/Exits (red zones) - no √Ælots placed near these

### 2. √élot Placement Rules
- User-configurable layout profiles with size distributions
- Automatic placement following constraints:
  - Avoids red and blue zones
  - Maintains minimum distances from entrances
  - Allows √Ælots to touch walls (except near entrances)
  - Optimizes space utilization

### 3. Corridor Generation
- Automatic corridor placement between √Ælot rows
- Configurable corridor width
- Ensures proper access paths between √Ælots
- No overlaps with existing √Ælots

### 4. Professional Features
- Real-time visualization with color-coded zones
- Statistical analysis and metrics
- Export to PDF reports and JSON data
- Demo mode with sample floor plans
- Enterprise-grade user interface
